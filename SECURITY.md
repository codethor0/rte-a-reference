# Security Policy

## Reporting Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this reference implementation, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue** for security-sensitive findings. Instead, contact the repository owner directly through your preferred secure channel.

This is a **reference implementation** of the Red Team Engineering Algorithm (RTE-A). It is intended for:

- Learning and evaluation
- Integration into governed red team workflows
- Demonstrating typed tasking, audit logging, and ephemeral infrastructure patterns

It is **not** a production service or security-critical runtime. No secrets, credentials, or sensitive configuration are stored in this repository. Sample values (emails, engagement IDs) are placeholders for demonstration.

## Scope

When reporting, please describe:

- The nature of the finding
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if any)

We aim to address reports in a timely manner but cannot guarantee SLAs for a reference implementation.
